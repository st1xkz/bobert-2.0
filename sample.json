    "description":"**1. Reporting a server member**\nIf your question is regarding an issue with a fellow server member, please be sure to include their Discord ID and any other relevant information so that we may quickly identify them ([how to find a User/Server/Message ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-))\n\n**2. Appealing an infraction**\nThis is pretty new to the server as a whole but if a staff member gave you an infraction of any kind and you think it was unnecessary and absurd that it happened, then please be sure to explain your side of the story and include any information you think is relevant and needed, we're here to sort it out with you!\n\n**3. Any other inconveniences**\nIf you need to talk about any other inconvenience that has occured within your time on the server, please make sure to state what you made the ticket for, any problems you have/had and a staff member will get to you as soon as they can. Remember that we are human, so you should treat us as such!"
